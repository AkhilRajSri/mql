# MQL

MQL (My Query Language) is a powerful tool to transform natural language queries into executable SQL queries. What's cool is that anyone can use it, even without knowing how to code. Just add your database by connecting or uploading schema to MQL, ask a query in your language and get the SQL.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started



https://github.com/shurutech/mql/assets/127201055/dac40920-6b22-4758-8f4d-efea9ca121fc



### Run the tool locally using Docker.

- Make sure you have docker installed. 

- To begin, clone this Git repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shurutech/mql
  ```

- Update server/Dockerfile with your `OPENAI_API_KEY` key:
  ```
  ENV OPENAI_API_KEY YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
  ```

- Update the DATABASE_URL in the server/.env file according to the following rules:
  - If you are using docker to run mql, you can use host.docker.internal to connect to the local machine, and use the port number of the docker container to connect to the local machine. If you're on a Linux machine, and this doesn't work, try using your localhost IP.
  - If you are not using docker to run mql, you can use localhost to connect to the local machine, and use the port number of the local machine to connect to the local machine.

- Navigate to the repository folder and run the following command:
  ```
  make install
  ```

  Once the installation is complete, you can access the MQL dashboard at: http://localhost:3000


---

If needed, you can also restart to reflect local changes, if any, using:
```
make restart
```

Also, you can terminate the local setup using:
```
make down
```

Also, you can start up all the containers using:
```
make up
```

## Use Default Email/Password for Login to Test MQL
A default user is created for login purpose while running the tool using docker. 
  - Email - admin@example.com
  - Password - admin

## Want to Productionize MQL?
Take care of below steps if you are looking to make it Live
  - **Delete default user**: To delete default user(admin@example.com), you need to connect with mql database(mql-postgres) and then remove it from users table. 
  - **Create a new user**:
    - go to project's root directory 
    - exec in backend docker container: docker-compose exec backend /bin/bash 
    - run create_user script: python3 scripts/create_user.py
    - enter email, password and name to create your own user

## Supported Databases

As of the current version, MQL is designed to work exclusively with PostgreSQL. 

----

## **You can also run the tool locally without Docker.**

  - ## Prerequisites

    These are the required packages which needs to be installed to run the project locally.

1. Python

2. psycopg2

3. Node

4. PostgreSQL 15

5. pgvector extension for PostgreSQL - [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#installation)

- ## Database Setup

  Run these commands in your PostgreSQL command line client

1. **Creating the PostgreSQL Role**

   Create a PostgreSQL role with superuser permissions and login capability:

   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE <role_name> WITH superuser;
   ALTER ROLE <role_name> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
   ```

2. **Creating the Databases**

   Create two databases, `mql` and `mql_test`, with the `shuru` role:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE mql WITH OWNER <role_name>;
   CREATE DATABASE mql_test WITH OWNER <role_name>;
   ```

3. **Creating the Extension**

   To create the `vector` extension:

- Connect with the database using:

  ```sql
  \c <databse_name>
  ```

- Create the vector extension:
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION vector;
  ```

- ## Update your env
  
  Update these values at server/.env

  ```env
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<role_name>:<password>@<host>:5432/mql"

  TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<role_name>:<password>@<host>:5432/mql_test"

  OPENAI_API_KEY="<key>"
  ```

  If database is locally hosted then host will be `localhost`

- ## Run the Script

  Navigate to the repository folder and run the command in terminal

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
  ```
Once the installation is complete, you can access the MQL dashboard at: http://localhost:3000


## Accuracy Test Score 
Our testing process involved running 50 natural language queries through the MQL platform, with resources like a elearning_schema file, and a CSV of query mappings located in our test_data folder. The MQL achieved around **85% success rate**, accurately translating 43 out of 50 queries. However, when considering the precision of the translations, about 74% (37 out of 50) of the queries were executed perfectly, with 6 queries correctly interpreted but missing a semi-colon at the end. This left us with 7 queries that resulted in errors. We're actively working on enhancements to improve both the accuracy and the completeness of the SQL syntax generation, and we welcome contributions to help refine our platform.
 - We have taken database set from [here](https://github.com/lingyingyang/elearning/blob/master/resources/eldb_bk.sql) for testing purpose.
 - You can remove test_data folder after checking it.

## Next Steps/Features
We plan to continue building after the initial release and look forward to the feedback from the community. As of now we have following features planned out for next releases.

 - Implementation of query execution
 - Improve directly connected dbs and SQL query results
 - Support for MySQL database
 - Improvements in Query Accuracy
 - Show natural language response and data visualisation.
 - User can integrate slack or similar apps to get NL query result there.
 - Test [retool](https://retool.com/products/ai) to generate the queries.
